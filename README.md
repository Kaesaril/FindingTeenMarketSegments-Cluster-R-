Teenagers engaging on social networking services like Facebook, Tumblr, and Instagram have become a sought-after demographic for businesses due to their substantial disposable income. Marketers, aiming to target this vast teenage consumer base, seek an edge in the competitive market by identifying segments with shared tastes.

The process involves identifying distinct segments and determining how these clusters can be effectively utilized for targeted advertising.
